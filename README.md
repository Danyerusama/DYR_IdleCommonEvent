## Appendix
The DYR_IdleCommonEvent plugin introduces an engaging way to interact with players by triggering a designated Common Event after a specific idle time. With this plugin, you can seamlessly integrate events into moments of player inactivity, creating opportunities for immersive storytelling, helpful tips, or any kind of interactive content you envision.


## Features

- Automatically triggers a Common Event after a certain idle time.
- Define the Common Event ID to be triggered when the player is idle.
- Customize the idle time duration.
- Enable or disable the plugin using script calls.


## Installation

1. Download the `DYR_IdleCommonEvent.js` plugin file.
2. Place the file in your RPG Maker MV project's `js/plugins/` directory.
3. In RPG Maker MV, open the Plugin Manager and activate the `DYR_IdleCommonEvent` plugin.

    
## Usage

1. Install the plugin and configure the desired Common Event ID and idle time in the plugin parameters.
2. During events, you can use the following script calls to enable or disable the plugin:
   - To enable the plugin: `IdleCommonEventEnable()`
   - To disable the plugin: `IdleCommonEventDisable()`
3. When the plugin is disabled, the Common Event won't trigger, and the player can move freely without any idle event.
